# Scenario: Verification fail — claim not ready and billing data unreliable.

name: verify_fail_false_claim_ready
description: >
  Validate claim where the tool returns ready=false with errors AND
  data_warnings: ["billing_fetch_failed"]. The billing data itself is
  unreliable, so verification should fail since any claim assessment
  is built on incomplete data.
